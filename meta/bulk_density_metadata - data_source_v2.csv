However, afforestation in grassland soils may have the opposite effect by promoting the loss of native carbon. Potential effects of this land use change on the flow of organic carbon to and from the soil can be described through bulk density (Db). Nowadays the suitability of Db for this purpose is being questioned. In order to bring new elements to the discussion, we carried out a comparative study of soil in the western region of Uruguay. Based on the background information and our own data, collected for over a decade, we evaluated the fitness of Db as proxy soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in grassland converted to tree afforestation. These data were also related to soil pH values. The sampling consisted of five plots afforested with Eucalyptus grandis paired with control plots under grassland. All samples were taken at depth (0–10 cm and 10–20 cm) except for Db samples (0–10 cm). In afforested sites, Db increased (1.62 vs 1.53 g/cm3; p ≤ 0.01) and SOC decreased (0–10 cm: 0.90 vs. 1.22%; p ≤ 0.08). Db values were not significantly correlated with SOC content. As with SOC, pH values decreased after afforestation at both depths (0–10 cm: 4.92 vs. 5.62; p ≤ 0.01; 10–20 cm: 4.76 vs. 5.54; p ≤ 0.01). The high acidity generated in soils following afforestation, is enough to affect the interaction between mineral and organic fractions and, with them, the original Db values. According to a previous study in the same location, there is a change in the predominance of different clay minerals in the topsoil (0–20 cm). This qualitative change in the mineral fraction can affect the ability of the soil to retain organic carbon, and not be reflected in the recorded Db values. The non-reciprocity recorded between Db and SOC values warns about the need for restriction of the generic use of Db in calculation of SOC stocks estimation. In view of these results, we present a discussion of possible causes that explain the disparity between Db values and SOC measurements.",see in text table 3; Soil organic carbon. Bulk density.

The grain yield of wheat was significantly influenced by the tillage systems whereas the thousand grain weight and plant height were not. Tillage systems also had significant influence on the soil Db. Generally the treatments with higher Db produced lower grain yield, thereby showing a negative relation between the two parameters. The presence of crop residue on top of the soil-surface proved to be very important; and in its absence, the wheat yield was lower and the Db was higher. Highest grain yield and lowest Db were observed under zero tillage, thus indicating no need for any tillage except for the control of weeds.",in table 4

Therefore, monitoring the impact of LSM is essential to an assessment of the potential agronomic and environmental benefits and risks associated with management practices. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of LSM on the chemical and physical attributes of soil under pasture (Cynodon spp.), located in southern Brazil. Four areas were sampled: three areas cultivated with Cynodon spp. pasture with successive applications of 200 m3 ha–1 y–1 of LSM for three, eight and 15 years; and untreated native forest as a reference. The soil attributes evaluated were: organic carbon (OC), active (pH water) and potential acidity (H + Al+ 3), nutrient availability (i.e., P, K, Ca, Mg, Cu and Zn), soil bulk density, macro, micro and total porosity. Successive applications of LSM on pasture reduced soil active acidity, and increased the soil organic C and plant-available N, P, Ca, Mg, Cu and Zn contents. These effects were more intense with time and in the shallowest layers, i.e. 0-10 cm. Excessive increases in P, Cu and Zn in the soil should be carefully monitored to minimize the contamination risks to soil, ground and surface waters. Soil physical attribute changes were more associated with land use (pasture versus native forest) than LSM use, and LSM applications induced slight improvements in the soil structural quality over time.",

In total, 5023 infiltration curves were collected across all continents. These data were either provided and quality checked by the scientists who performed the experiments or they were digitized from published articles. Data from 54 different countries were included in the database with major contributions from Iran, China, and USA. In addition to its global spatial coverage, the collected infiltration curves cover a time span of research from 1976 to late 2017. In addition to infiltration data, basic information of the measurement location, the measurement method, soil properties, and land use were collected, which makes the database valuable for the development of pedo-transfer functions for estimating soil hydraulic properties, for the evaluation of infiltration measurement methods and for developing and validating infiltration models. Soil textural information (clay, silt, and sand content) is available for 3842 out of 5023 infiltration measurements (~76%) covering nearly all soil USDA textural classes except for the sandy clay and silt classes. Information on the land use is available for 76 % of experimental sites with agricultural land use as the dominant type (~40%). We are convinced that the SWIG database will allow for a better parametrization of the infiltration process in land surface models and for testing infiltration models. All collected data and related soil characteristics are provided online in *.xlsx and *.csv formats for reference, and we add a disclaimer that the database is for use by public domain only and can be copied freely by referencing it.

In the present study, sampling was conducted from May to November 2011 in Henan province, a typical agricultural region of central China, to study the effects of soil properties and anthropogenic factors on SOC variability in cropland. Physicochemical properties of soil samples were analyzed, which were collected at 280 sites from the surface layer (at a depth of 0–20 cm), and related data about the sampling sites were also collected from the Second State Soil Survey of China (SSSSC), conducted in 1981. The main results were as follows: 1) Increasing trends in soil organic carbon density (SOCD) and soil organic carbon pool (SOCP) were obvious from 1981 to 2011, and we conclude that cropland presents great carbon sequestration potential for the future. Carbon pool ability varied with soil properties: the order of fixed carbon amount in different soil types was found to be Inceptisols > Luvisols > Semi-hydromorphic soil > Anthrosols, and the average SOCP increased significantly from 1981 to 2011. 2) Soil bulk density, pH and returning straw are the key influence factors for SOCD in the past 30 years. 3) Although random factors (returning straw) only explain 29.1% of SOCD variability, the factor should be paid more attention, because application of returning strawwas the most dominant anthropogenic factors, which can be used to improve cropland productivity and carbon sink capacity within a short period if they are properly managed in the future.",

Here, we bring together hundreds of thousands of C-cycle observations at the Harvard Forest in central Massachusetts, USA, a mid-latitude landscape dominated by 80–120-year-old closed-canopy forests. These data answered four questions: (i) where and how much C is presently stored in dominant forest types; (ii) what are current rates of C accrual or loss; (iii) what biotic and abiotic factors contribute to variability in these rates; and (iv) is climate change affecting the forest’s C cycle? Harvard Forest is an active C sink resulting from forest regrowth following land abandonment. Soil and tree biomass comprise nearly equal portions of existing C stocks. Net primary production (NPP) averaged 750–970 g C m-2 yr-1; belowground NPP contributed 30–60% of the total. Mineral soil C measured in the same inventory plots in 1992 and 2013 were too heterogeneous to detect change in soil-C pools; however, radiocarbon data suggest a small but persistent sink of 10–30 g C m-2 yr-1. Net ecosystem production (NEP) in hardwood stands averaged ~300 g C m-2 yr-1. NEP in hemlock-dominated forests averaged ~450 g C m-2 yr-1 prior to infestation by the hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA) in 2013, and then became a net C source. Stand dynamics and climate change in the last three decades enhanced the C sink in hardwood stands; NPP increased 26% between 2000–2014 (p = 0.02) and NEP increased 93% between 1992–2015 (p = 0.13). Compared to long-term global change experiments at the Harvard Forest, the C sink in regrowing biomass equaled or exceeded C cycle modifications imposed by soil warming, N saturation, and hemlock removal. Median forest biomass in the surrounding ecoregion was only 78% of that at the Harvard Forest due to higher timber harvesting rates across the region. Results of this synthesis and comparison to simulation models suggest that forests across the region are likely to accrue C for decades to come but may be disrupted if the frequency or severity of disturbance increases.",
